# Introduction

* First off, thank you for considering contributing to smolink.


* There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into smolink itself.



# Your First Contribution

* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
* Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.


### Link to resources for people who have never contributed to open source before.
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

* Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

* Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:


### Submitting a pull request
* The smaller the proposed change, the better. If youâ€™d like to propose two unrelated changes, submit two pull requests.

* The more information, the better. Make judicious use of the pull request body. Describe what changes were made, why you made them, and what impact they will have for users.

* If this is your first pull request, it may help to understand [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

# Community
* You can chat with the community [here]().
